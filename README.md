# metr3334
This repository holds a program which reads in dual-doppler analysis, 
formats the data, and plots reflectivity and wind barbs. This data 
can be found here: https://zenodo.org/record/1453446#.ZEhlSuzMLFo

This data is from Alford et al. (2019) and used in the following 
paper: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GL080013

This program is for my METR 3334 class at the University of Oklahoma.
This class serves as preperation for my capstone project next semester.
My group and I will be studying tropical cyclones with weather radar,
and I selected to plot this dual-doppler analysis to start getting 
familiar with this type of data and prepare for using it next semester.
My group plans to work with TC experts here at OU and study more 
sparsley studied subjects like rainfall processes, electrification,
and tornadoes during TC landfall.
